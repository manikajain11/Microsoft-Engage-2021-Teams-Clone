## Product Description

### Microsoft Teams
The global workforce underwent a shocking and rapid switch to remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic. But that shift was never going to be temporary. The pandemic only accelerated a trend towards flex working that was well underway in 2019. The expected change posed a big question: How will workers collaborate when they're dispersed and constantly moving?
Cut back to today, the answer is Microsoft Teams. A collaboration platform that unifies chat, voice, video and file sharing as part of the Microsoft Office 365. It is currently designed to be used by local, remote and distributed work groups - anyone in any company, really! 🌃

# Methodology and Principles  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
### Agile Development Methodology 📆:
The entire workflow of the web application was deployed using the principles of agile methodology, where iterative development was followed for the implemented features and the requirements and solutions evolved with the growing feedback and usage. The entire duration of the development was divided by me into 3 primary sprints where each lasted for almost a week:
* **Sprint-1** : The duration of this entire sprint lasted a week where I primarily worked on designing my Product Requirements Document (PRD) and the UI/UX of the web application for various interfaces.
* **Sprint-2** : The duration of this sprint encompassed a week again where I started developing my minimal viable requirements (**Connecting two participants via meeting**) while tested and assimilated the code into my previously designed code segments.
* **Sprint-3** : Finally, during the last week of the sprint, I worked on the additional features of my product encompassing the feedback from previous sprints and adopted a CI/CD and TDD Approach. With the developer feedback at every stage, I build the test and then developed functionality until the code passed the test. Each time, when I made a new addition to the code, its test was added to the suite of tests that are run when I built the integrated work. This ensured that new additions don’t break the functioning work that came before them.

# User Journey

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 1. Types of Users 💻
### General User / Participant 👨‍🦱
He/she refers to the participant in the meeting invited via a URL. They can view video-streams of other participants, view the canvas, have the ability to mute/unmute themselves and participate in the chat messages. They can be converted into a controller by the administrator of the meeting.

### Administrator / Controller 🙋‍♀️
He/she is the creator of the unique room and known as the administrator of that particular room. They have the general admin powers like muting/unmuting themselves as well as other users, granting control to other participants and ending the meeting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. User Flow Journey and Navigation
The user flow journey designed on Figma, presents a clear navigation, understandable labelling, links and with well-labelled and consistent CTAs (Call-To-Action). It encompasses the complete flow starting from the landing page for the user till they are present in the meeting with other participants to chat, collaborate, etc.

### Landing Page 
When the user receives the link, he/she is directed to the main landing page either to join or start a meeting of their own. It caters to the idea of the application being free hence potentially leads to more user engagement and retention ratio. The UI/UX was designed keeping in mind the current colour palette of Microsoft Teams.
